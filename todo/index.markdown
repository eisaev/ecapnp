ecapnp Todo
===========

Here's an informal and rather incomplete list of stuff that still
needs some attention:

* Support for nested lists.
* Dynamic schema compilation (would prefer to call on the Cap'n Proto
  compiler using a NIF or driver).
* Needs better test coverage..
* Run some benchmarks to get an idea on performance.
